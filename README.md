# E08b-Adding-Tiles

Hello!

This is Excersie 8B for the game technology course.  In this exercise, we continued from where we left off last week and added bricks and the ability to break the bricks.  To do this, we created a grey tile script, and then we essentially copied it several times to create rows of bricks of other colors.

Thanks for checking out my work!
